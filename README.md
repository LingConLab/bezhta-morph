# Bezhta morphology
The current work is dedicated to building a morphological analyzer for Bezhta language (< Tsezic < Avar-Andic-Tsezic < Nakh-Dagestan; Glottolog: bezh1248). This repository contains a prototype for a Bezhta morphological analyzer. It is a part of a larger project by the students of the [School of Linguistics](https://ling.hse.ru/en/) and the [Linguistic Convergence Laboratory](https://ilcl.hse.ru/en/) at the NRU HSE that aims to provide digital tools for endangered languages.
